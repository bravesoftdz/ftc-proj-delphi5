           =========================================

			  *****

1. RUNNING THE INSTALLATION PROGRAM

   The installation program allows you to set up your CD-ROM drive 
   under Windows 3.1/DOS or Windows 95.

   To set up your drive in Windows 3.1/DOS, run INSTALL.EXE at the 
   DOS prompt.

   To set up your drive in Windows 95, run SETUP.EXE in Windows 95.


2. MSCDEX.EXE DRIVER

   To use your CD-ROM drive under Windows 3.1 or DOS, the 
   Microsoft CD-ROM extension driver (MSCDEX.EXE) must be loaded.

   The installation allows you to search for this driver in your 
   system. It will then copy this driver to your <dir>\DRV directory 
   and place a command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to load this 
   driver when your system boots up.

     Note : <dir> is your target installation directory.

   If you do not have the MSCDEX.EXE driver in your system,option 2 
   allows you to add a remarked statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  
   If you do so, you will then need to obtain this driver from your 
   vendor and copy it to your <dir>\DRV sub-directory.  Finally, 
   remember to remove "REM" from the command that loads the 
   MSCDEX.EXE driver in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
