TDADRISCAN components v 1.0


This archive contains the following components for Delphi 3 or higher

TDADIRSCAN
TDADIRSCANTREEVIEW
TDADIRSCANLISTVIEW

and a demo program to test-drive them

These components will scan a given dir and generate an event each time a new file or directory is found or added.
TDADirScan will just scan the directory
TDADirScanTreeView will fill a treeview with its content
TDADirScanListView will fill a listview

You can subclass TDaDirScan if you want other components to be filled.

This component will allow you to separate the content (in this case : file system) from the way it is represented (treeview, listview or other).
