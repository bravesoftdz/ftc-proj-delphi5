UNINSTALLER by DIEGO AMICABILE

A simple way to package your application with an uninstaller. Just
create a batch file with whatever icon you want and let it execute
this single command

dauninst <application-name>

the application will be uninstalled from your computer.

Source code is included if you want to reduce file size.
